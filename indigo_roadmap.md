 [1]Release types can be Debian, source, or none.  Debians are released through the official ROS release process.  Source releases are made through properly named branches (in this case indigo).  Experimental and some other repos are not officially released.  In the case of experimental repos, any packages ready for release should be migrated to non-experimental repos
 
 [2]Release type has changed or new release type is targeted.
